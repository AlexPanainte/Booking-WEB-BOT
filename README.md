2 - Users can input their desired location , and the bot will automatically select that location on the booking website.
 
3 - The script allows users to input the check-in and check-out dates so that the bot can search for availability in the specified date range.
   
4 - users can specify the number of adults for whom they wish to make the reservation.

5 - The bot will initiate a search on the booking website with the previously specified parameters.

6 - The filtration function enables users to apply certain criteria for selecting accommodations, such as a maximum price or a minimum star rating.

7 - The bot will refresh the page to ensure that the results are up-to-date and displayed correctly.

8 - At the end of the process, the bot will provide users with a report of the results found according to the specified parameters, allowing them to make an informed decision about their desired accommodation.
